Dish App README:
 this project is a form that allows users to create a new dish with specific attributes based on the dish type selected. The form takes in various inputs such as the dish name, preparation time, dish type, number of pizza slices, diameter, spiciness scale, and slices of bread.

The form uses the React library and hooks such as useState to manage the form state and axios to make HTTP POST requests to an API endpoint to create a new dish. The form also uses the Lodash library to format and transform data such as converting strings to camel case and start case.

The project follows a responsive design and includes error handling and validation to ensure that all required fields are filled out correctly before submitting the form. Any errors that occur during the form submission are caught and displayed to the user.
